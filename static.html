            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Static and dynamic websites are two common approaches to web development. Static websites are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering simplicity, fast loading times, and enhanced security. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, use server-side technologies like PHP or Python to generate content in real-time, enabling interactive features and personalized experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Static websites are ideal for content that doesn't require frequent updates or user interaction, while dynamic websites excel in providing real-time updates and interactive functionalities. Understanding the differences between these two approaches will help you make informed decisions about your web development projects.</p>

            <h2>Static Websites</h2>
            <p>Static websites are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They consist of fixed files that are delivered to the user's browser as-is. These websites are ideal for displaying content that doesn't require frequent updates or user interaction. Static websites are known for their simplicity, fast loading times, and enhanced security.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Websites</h2>
            <p>Dynamic websites utilize server-side technologies like PHP, Python, or Node.js to generate content on the fly. These websites can pull data from databases, interact with users, and provide personalized experiences. Dynamic websites are often used for e-commerce platforms, social media sites, or any web application that requires real-time data updates and interactive functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p>The key differences between static and dynamic websites lie in their content management, scalability, and maintenance. Static websites typically require manual updates and editing of HTML files, while dynamic websites can retrieve and display content dynamically from databases or external sources. Dynamic websites offer greater flexibility and customization options, but they may also require more resources and optimization efforts for scalability and performance.</p>

            <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
            <p>When choosing between static and dynamic websites, factors to consider include project requirements, budget, and technical expertise. Static websites are suitable for simple content, while dynamic websites excel in providing interactive features. Scalability and performance considerations should also be taken into account, as dynamic websites may require more resources and optimization efforts.</p>

            <h2>Best Use Cases</h2>
            <p>Static websites are well-suited for personal portfolios, informational websites, or any content that doesn't change frequently. Dynamic websites shine in scenarios such as e-commerce platforms, social media sites, or applications requiring real-time updates. Evaluating your project goals and requirements will help determine which approach aligns best with your needs.</p>

        <p>
            As it relates to creating websites, static and dynamic refers to how content is displayed and delivered to end-users. 
            With static websites, every user has access to the same contents (i.e. AWS documentation), wheras dynamic websites are configured to present tailored content dependent on end-users (i.e. Youtube).
